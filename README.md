# Sims-HCI-Project-Group-5-Team-B

Project developed for the purpose of SIMS (Specification and Software Modeling) and HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) courses on Faculty of Technical Sciences in Novi Sad.

## About project

Application booking was developed as a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application using C# and XAML. Data management was done through CSV files stored in Resources/Data folder. Each student was primarily responsible for designing and implementing the functionalities of one of the four applications for different users, while looking after specified requirements.

There is a variety of devices on which the application is used, as well as user profiles for which it is primarily intended.

The project was implemented following SOLID principles, design patterns, and the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.
